        Tag categories can be automatically applied to time rows and time groups by auto-tagging. However, tag categories cannot be posted.
        The purpose of tag categories is to give the user as much help as possible with auto-tagging if we are unable to match a specific tag but are able to match on a group of tags. The user then just needs to select one of the tags in the category, rather than having to start with a fresh tag search.
